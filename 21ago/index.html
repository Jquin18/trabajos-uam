            <p class="inter-400">Ever since I was a boy, I've been fascinated with movies. I loved the characters and the excitement—but most of all the stories. I wanted to be an actor. And I believed that I'd get to do the things that Indiana Jones did and go on exciting adventures. I even dreamed up ideas for movies that my friends and I could make and star in. But they never went any further. I did, however, end up working in user experience (UX). Now, I realize that there's an element of theater to UX—I hadn't really considered it before, but user research is storytelling. And to get the most out of user research, you need to tell a good story where you bring stakeholders—the product team and decision makers—along and get them interested in learning more.</p>
            <p  class="inter-400">Think of your favorite movie. More than likely it follows a three-act structure that's commonly seen in storytelling: the setup, the conflict, and the resolution. The first act shows what exists today, and it helps you get to know the characters and the challenges and problems that they face. Act two introduces the conflict, where the action is. Here, problems grow or get worse. And the third and final act is the resolution. This is where the issues are resolved and the characters learn and change. I believe that this structure is also a great way to think about user research, and I think that it can be especially helpful in explaining user research to others.</p>

            <h2 class="dm-serif-text-regular">Use storytelling as a structure to do research</h2>
            <p class="inter-400">It's sad to say, but many have come to see research as being expendable. If budgets or timelines are tight, research tends to be one of the first things to go. Instead of investing in research, some product managers rely on designers or—worse—their own opinion to make the “right” choices for users based on their experience or accepted best practices. That may get teams some of the way, but that approach can so easily miss out on solving users' real problems. To remain user-centered, this is something we should avoid. User research elevates design. It keeps it on track, pointing to problems and opportunities. Being aware of the issues with your product and reacting to them can help you stay ahead of your competitors.</p>
            <p class="inter-400">In the three-act structure, each act corresponds to a part of the process, and each part is critical to telling the whole story. Let's look at the different acts and how they align with user research.</p>
            <h2 class="dm-serif-text-regular">ACT ONE: SETUP</h2>
            <p class="inter-400">The setup is all about understanding the background, and that's where foundational research comes in. Foundational research (also called generative, discovery, or initial research) helps you understand users and identify their problems. You're learning about what exists today, the challenges users have, and how the challenges affect them—just like in the movies. To do foundational research, you can conduct contextual inquiries or diary studies (or both!), which can help you start to identify problems as well as opportunities. It doesn't need to be a huge investment in time or money.</p>
            <p  class="inter-400">Erika Hall writes about minimum viable ethnography, which can be as simple as spending 15 minutes with a user and asking them one thing: “'Walk me through your day yesterday.' That's it. Present that one request. Shut up and listen to them for 15 minutes. Do your damndest to keep yourself and your interests out of it. Bam, you're doing ethnography.” According to Hall, “[This] will probably prove quite illuminating. In the highly unlikely case that you didn't learn anything new or useful, carry on with enhanced confidence in your direction.”</p>
            <p>This makes total sense to me. And I love that this makes user research so accessible. You don't need to prepare a lot of documentation; you can just recruit participants and do it! This can yield a wealth of information about your users, and it'll help you better understand them and what's going on in their lives. That's really what act one is all about: understanding where users are coming from.</p>

            <p>Jared Spool talks about the importance of foundational research and how it should form the bulk of your research. If you can draw from any additional user data that you can get your hands on, such as surveys or analytics, that can supplement what you've heard in the foundational studies or even point to areas that need further investigation. Together, all this data paints a clearer picture of the state of things and all its shortcomings. And that's the beginning of a compelling story. It's the point in the plot where you realize that the main characters—or the users in this case—are facing challenges that they need to overcome. Like in the movies, this is where you start to build empathy for the characters and root for them to succeed. And hopefully stakeholders are now doing the same. Their sympathy may be with their business, which could be losing money because users can't complete certain tasks. Or maybe they do empathize with users' struggles. Either way, act one is your initial hook to get the stakeholders interested and invested.</p>
